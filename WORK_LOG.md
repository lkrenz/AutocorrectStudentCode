| March 12 | 5:30-6:00 |         I spent this time working on an efficient way to order the words before submitting them. I couldn't think of a way to sort the values as a 2D array, but I'm just realizing now there might be a way to do it using a variable in an object. Regardlesss, I forgot how to implement quicksort or mergesort, so I just decided to create the ordered list as I find hits in the dictionary. (This isn't working right now, so I will have debug in my next session). |
