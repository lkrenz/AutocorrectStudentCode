I couldn't think of a way to sort the values as a 2D array, but I'm just realizing now there might be a way to do it using a variable in an object. Regardlesss, I forgot how to implement quicksort or mergesort, so I just decided to create the ordered list as I find hits in the dictionary. (This isn't working right now, so I will have debug in my next session). |
| March 14 | 30 Minutes in class | I spent this time debugging the sorting part of my code and beginning to think about how I would filter out the majority of the words quickly. I was thinking about two main strategies. The first, will probably be a prt of my main solution, and it's simply removing words based off their length. If the difference in length between the words is greater than the edit distance threshold, we know we can immediately remove it. The other way I was trying to think about it was through the tokenization approach. The issue I was trying to reconcile in my mind was whether or not this would catch every possible word within the edit distance. It is unlikely that every other character in the word could be off, but it's definitly possible. For example, if you're using 2 letter pairs, and your word is apple, if you type axpxe, even through the edit distance is only two, it won't appear in the possible replacements. This kind of monte carlo approach is probably okay because the cases where this applies will be rare, but it still bugs me a little bit. |

For my innitial approach, I'm going with the tokenization approach in conjunction with a length checking scheme. I found a few ways to speed this up. instead of checking the intersection between the sets, I'm just going to check length as I add words to the set of tokenized words. I'm also going to use a hash set to check if there are any repeats in my set as I add them. |

I came up with a much better solution for finding the intersection between the length set and the tokenization set. It also makes it so I don't have to lookup words to ensure I don't have repeats. I first convert the dictionary into an arraylist through a linear traverse (not adding any words where the difference in length is greater than the threshold). Then, everytime I add a word during the tokenization approach, I remove it from the dictionary to ensure I don't have any repeats. I got a good start coding the solution, but I still need to try out the code and debug from there. |

I was very confused for a while, and just at the end, I realized that I never actually ran the tokenization method. I'll finish implementing this then work on a more novel solution next time. |
