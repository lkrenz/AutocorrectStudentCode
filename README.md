# Autocorrect
#### A word-suggestion project created by Zach Blick for Adventures in Algorithms at Menlo School in Atherton, CA
##### This algorithm works through two main components: the pre-processing of the dictionary and finding the edit distance between the word and strings in the dictionary. First, through n-Bit tokenization - seeing if strings of n characters are present in each word in the dictionary - and through length comparison - if the difference in length between the misspelled word and dictionary word are greater than the threshold, the word can be ignored - words are either included or excluded from the final dictionary. Then, through tabulation, the edit distance between each word in the dictionary and the misspelled word are calculated, and all words with edit distance less than the threshold are included in the output in order of edit distance, then alphabetical.
